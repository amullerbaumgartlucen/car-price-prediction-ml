# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the resale prices of second-hand cars using machine learning. We used a dataset with over 10,000 entries containing car features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. By applying and comparing different regression models, we were able to generate insights to help inform pricing strategies and evaluate business profitability.

## 📈 Key Highlights

- Processed 10,000+ car listings using `Pandas` and `NumPy`
- Applied ML models including `XGBoost`, `LightGBM`, and `Random Forest`
- Achieved high accuracy using optimized regression techniques and feature engineering
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **RMSE** and **R²**
- Analyzed **feature importance** to determine key drivers of car price
- Explored relationships between year, mileage, brand, and pricing using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`

## Motivation

Have been recently attempting to sell my car in the second hand market and have been getting increasilngly frustrated with the low prices my car has been receiving on websites online. Hence, I decided to explore how much my car was worth my trianing a ML model on a large dataset of second hand cars.
